## General guidelines
- If the session is in read-only mode: do not modify the repo in any way (no `apply_patch`, no commands that write files, no formatting/lint/test runs that rewrite or generate files). Only inspect files and propose changes; ask to switch to a write-enabled mode before making edits.
